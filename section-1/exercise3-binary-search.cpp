/*
 * 1) Create a function that receives a student's id number and returns their information
 * using binary search. Is it possible to create a binary search function that receives a student's
 * id number and returns their information? If not, what would be the alternatives?
 * Justify your answer.
 *
 * Yes, it is possible to create. The answer is in the code below. In it, we can perform this search,
 * but the id numbers must be in ascending order.
 *
 * 2) Create a function that receives a student's name and returns their information.
 * Is it possible to create a binary search function that receives a student's name and
 * returns their information? Justify your answer. If not, what would be the alternatives?
 * Justify your answer.
 *
 * It is not possible because it is not feasible to sort names in ascending order.
 * Therefore, the search would result in failures.
 *
 * 3) Create a function that receives an integer value indicating an age and returns the
 * quantity of students who are that age or younger. Is it possible to create a binary
 * search function that receives a student's age and returns the requested sum? If not,
 * what would be the alternatives? Justify your answer.
 *
 * It's not possible because we cannot traverse all the students using binary search.
